Reflection Note 

---What I had to learn---

I understand how SOCKS5 protocol works -> handshake steps, login/authentication, and the request/response messages. 
i studied the RFC 1928 and also looked at examples to see how implement it. 
i handle different types of addresses (IPv4, IPv6, domain names). 

--How I approached debugging---

I built the program step by step and tested each part on its own. 
 
For the login step, I made small test clients to check if the byte-level communication was right. 
i also added logging to follow the data as it moved through the process.
when I had problems with certain clients (curl), 
i checked their source code and documentation to see what they expected from a SOCKS5 server.

---Improvements Proxy Server---

1. allow credentials file (not hardcoded).
2. add clearer error handling and messages.
3. support UDP connection
4. add connection timeouts and better resource management.
5. improve performance so it can handle more users at once.
